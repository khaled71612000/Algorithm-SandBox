# Algorithm Sandbox

**Algorithm Sandbox** is a collection of various algorithm implementations using C. This repository serves as a practical reference for understanding and applying different algorithms.

## Key Components

### main.c
- The main C file containing the implementation of various algorithms.
- Demonstrates sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and other common computational procedures.

### algo rec.cbp, algo rec.depend, algo rec.layout
- Project files used for setting up the development environment and dependencies.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Includes implementations of common sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Search Algorithms:** Demonstrates binary search and other search techniques.
- **Project Setup:** Configuration files for compiling and running the code.
